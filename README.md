A machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features using python. 
Conducted exploratory data analysis with visualizations such as box plots and distribution plots to understand feature distributions and identify outliers. 
Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to filter out outliers. and Corrected feature skewness using transformations. 
Performed feature scaling and encoding to prepare the data for modeling. 
Evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. 
Optimized the Gradient Boosting model through hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV. 
Achieved optimal performance with the tuned Gradient Boosting model, assessed using RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error.
